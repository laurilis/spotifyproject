## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to show that I am capable of using React (and GitHub). No other purpose seems to exist. This Web App does not seem to be needed.

## Technologies
This project was built using React, GitHub and Visual Studio Code. Who would have guessed!

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Securely log in to your Spotify account using OAuth.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for songs using Spotify's search API.
- **Playlist Management**: Create, add, and remove tracks from your playlist.
- **Export Playlist**: Save your playlist to your Spotify account.

## Future
For the moment no future work regarding the Spotify jammming project is desired. I am glad this hell has come to an end. Possibly the project will be optimized as it is functional but not perfect (I am sure).
